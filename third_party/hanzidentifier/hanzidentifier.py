    Simplified characters. The :data:`TRADITIONAL`, :data:`SIMPLIFIED`,

    string's identity. If *s* contains no Chinese characters, then
    :data:`UNKNOWN` is returned.

    All characters in a string that aren't found in the CC-CEDICT dictionary
    are ignored.

    Because the Traditional and Simplified Chinese character systems overlap, a
    string containing Simplified characters could identify as
    :data:`SIMPLIFIED` or :data:`BOTH` depending on if the characters are also
    Traditional characters. To make testing the identity of a string easier,
